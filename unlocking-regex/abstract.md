Using regular expressions is a skill every IT Pro should have in their toolbox. But many people don't know where to start or why it matters. In this session, long-time PowerShell teacher Jeff Hicks will introduce you to regular expression fundamentals that you can use at the console or in your scripts. You discover how to build basic patterns you will often use in your scripting. You'll learn about parameter validation with regular expressions and how to grep in Windows with `Select-String`.

Finally, we'll explore some advanced regex topics like named captures and look-aheads. You can't learn everything in a single session, but you'll learn enough to drive away the fear and get you started down the right path.
